                Kidney cancer treatment varies depending on factors like cancer type, stage, and overall health. Options include:

                1) Active Surveillance: Monitoring small tumors for growth.

                2) Thermal Ablation: Destroying tumors with heat or cold for select early-stage cases.

                3) Surgery (Nephrectomy): Removing part or all of the kidney, often curative.

                4) Drug Therapy: For advanced cases:

                    i) Immunotherapy: Boosting the immune system to combat cancer.
                    
                    ii) Targeted Therapy: Inhibiting cancer cell growth and blood vessel formation.
                        
                Treatment choices depend on individual circumstances, with a focus on preserving kidney function and managing side effects.
                Advanced therapies like immunotherapy and targeted therapy offer promising options for patients with advanced kidney cancer.
